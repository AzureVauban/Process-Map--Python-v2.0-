"""
Restructured main.py script
Changes:
- inputting and outputting ingredient trees into csv file
- the ability to search for ingredients for ease of typing out the ingredient tree
- user can take an ingredient tree from a csv file and use it as a template for a new recipe
= allow for usage of basic arithmetic operators when prompted to input a number (still in progress)
